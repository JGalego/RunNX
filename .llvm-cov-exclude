# RunNX Code Coverage Exclusion Configuration
# This file contains patterns for files/directories to exclude from code coverage analysis
#
# Reasons for exclusion:
# - Auto-generated files (protobuf, build scripts)
# - Binary entry points with minimal logic
# - Test utilities and mock implementations
#
# Format: One file pattern per line, supports glob patterns
#

# Auto-generated protobuf bindings
src/onnx.rs

# CLI binary entry point 
src/bin/runner.rs

# Build script
build.rs

# Formal specification and verification module
src/formal.rs
