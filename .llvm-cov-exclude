# RunNX Code Coverage Exclusion Configuration
# This file contains patterns for files/directories to exclude from code coverage analysis
#
# Reasons for exclusion:
# - Auto-generated files (protobuf, build scripts)
# - Binary entry points with minimal logic
# - Test utilities and mock implementations
#
# Format: One file pattern per line, supports glob patterns
#

# Auto-generated protobuf definitions
src/onnx.rs

# Binary entry points (CLI applications)
src/bin/runner.rs

# Build scripts and generated code
build.rs
