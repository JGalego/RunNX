## [unreleased]

### Bug Fixes

- Resolve GitHub release workflow tar error

### Features

- Added formal verification üßÆ
- ONNX binary support
- Added formal operator verification

## [0.1.1] - 2025-07-24

### ‚ú® Features

- **üîß ONNX Binary Format Support**: Full support for standard ONNX protobuf binary format
  - `Model::from_onnx_file()` and `Model::to_onnx_file()` methods
  - Automatic format detection based on file extension
  - Seamless conversion between JSON and ONNX binary formats
  - Smaller file sizes (~60% compression vs JSON)
  - Faster loading performance for binary format
  - Full interoperability with other ONNX runtime implementations

- **üßÆ Formal Verification System**: Mathematical verification of operator correctness using Why3
  - Comprehensive Why3 specifications for all ONNX operators (Add, Mul, MatMul, ReLU, Sigmoid, Transpose, Reshape)
  - Automated verification pipeline with Alt-Ergo theorem prover
  - Runtime contract verification with formal assertions
  - Property-based testing for mathematical properties (commutativity, associativity, monotonicity)
  - Complete verification automation with Python integration

### üöÄ Enhancements

- **Format Auto-Detection**: `Model::from_file()` automatically detects JSON (.json) vs ONNX (.onnx) formats
- **Dual Format CLI**: Command-line runner now supports both JSON and ONNX binary model files
- **Comprehensive Examples**: Added `onnx_demo.rs` demonstrating format compatibility and conversion
- **Enhanced Documentation**: New format compatibility guide with best practices
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Fixed Windows CI issues with platform-independent file paths
- **CI/CD Improvements**: Enhanced formal verification pipeline with proper dependency management
- **Test Coverage Enhancement**: Improved overall test coverage to 96.48% with comprehensive CLI testing
- **Workflow Consolidation**: Unified coverage pipeline into main CI workflow for better maintainability

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- **Windows CI Compatibility**: Fixed hardcoded Unix paths causing Windows test failures
- **Protocol Buffers Support**: Added missing `protoc` installation in CI jobs
- **Formal Verification Integration**: Fixed conditional test compilation for formal verification features
- **Dependency Updates**: Updated GitHub Actions and resolved security vulnerabilities
- **CLI Binary Availability**: Fixed "No such file or directory" errors in CI by ensuring runner binary is built before coverage tests

### üìö Documentation

- Added comprehensive [Format Compatibility Guide](docs/FORMAT_COMPATIBILITY.md)
- Updated README with dual format examples and usage patterns
- Improved code documentation with format-specific examples
- Complete formal verification documentation and examples

## [0.1.0] - 2025-07-21
